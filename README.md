# Our Team

This is a script that converts data regarding members of a work team into objects and subsequently prints this information into the console and into the DOM.

1. Create an array of objects containing the data.  
2. Print the data into the console. Use a for...in loop inside a for loop to cycle through all the properties of each object.  
3. Create the member slides and use a for loop to append them to a document fragment.  
4. Append the entire fragment to the parent div in the html.  
5. Make everything pretty with css.
